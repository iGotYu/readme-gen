# Readme Generator 

## Overview
For this assignment we are tasked to create a Readme Generator that produces a high-quality README. The README is to include a title, how to use it,how to install the app, how to report issues, and how to contribute. At the base of the file there is links to the inputted GitHub account and an email to contact the user by. 

## Javascript
In this assignment we were given some starter code but for the most part and I made a couple of changes to make the application run. First I included the packages needed for this assignment and also downloaded a basic inquirer package. Then i called on those packages and created an array of the questions. The user is then to run the node function and fill out he form in their terminals.  To make sure the information is being collected we created sections and call upon the responses pulled in by the user in order to create a README filled with the information in the designated areas. These fields can be changed upon the user change or the information being changed. There is also a table of content that when clicked can direct the user to the given area.
